## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- (Optional) virtual environment tool: `python -m venv .venv`

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/day-20-snake.git
cd day-20-snake

# 2. (Optional) Create & activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

## ▶️ How to Play

```bash
python main.py
```

* Use the **arrow keys** to move the snake.
* Eat the food (🐭) to grow longer.
* Don’t run into the walls or the snake’s own tail!

## 🔧 Features

* **Modular code**: `snake.py`, `food.py`, and `scoreboard.py` each handle their own logic.
* **Score tracking**: The scoreboard increases as you eat food and resets on collision.
* **Clean exit**: Click the window’s close button to end the game.

## 📋 Dependencies

Listed in `requirements.txt`:

```
turtle
```

*(No other external libraries required.)*

## 🛠️ Development

* Feel free to tweak speed, colors, window size, or add new features (walls, levels, high-score persistence).
* If you add new dependencies, don’t forget to re-generate:

  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
